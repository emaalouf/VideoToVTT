echo "🔄 VideoToVTT Server Sync Helper - STRICT TRANSLATION MODE + TIME ESTIMATION"
echo "============================================================================="
echo ""

echo "⚠️  IMPORTANT: STRICT TRANSLATION MODE ENABLED"
echo "   🚫 NO FALLBACK translations - LLM must work"
echo "   🚫 NO PLACEHOLDER text accepted"
echo "   ✅ Only real, validated translations allowed"
echo ""

echo "⏰ NEW: COMPREHENSIVE TIME ESTIMATION"
echo "   📊 Real-time progress tracking with ETAs"
echo "   🎯 Individual video completion estimates"
echo "   📈 Overall batch completion estimates"
echo "   ⚡ Phase-by-phase timing analysis"
echo ""

echo "📋 STEPS TO DEPLOY THE FIX:"
echo ""

echo "1️⃣  Copy the fixed fast-processor.js to your server:"
echo "   scp fast-processor.js user@your-server:/path/to/VideoToVTT/"
echo ""

echo "2️⃣  SSH into your server and restart PM2:"
echo "   ssh user@your-server"
echo "   cd /path/to/VideoToVTT"
echo "   pm2 restart videotovtt-turbo"
echo ""

echo "3️⃣  Monitor the logs to see the fix working:"
echo "   pm2 logs videotovtt-turbo --lines 50"
echo ""

echo "🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED & ADDED:"
echo "  ✅ Verification now focuses on local VTT files (primary success criteria)"
echo "  ✅ Uploaded captions are checked separately and don't block processing"
echo "  ✅ Added 2-second delay for API sync before caption verification"
echo "  ✅ More graceful handling of API delays and 404 errors"
echo "  🚫 REMOVED all translation fallbacks - strict quality enforcement"
echo "  🔍 Added VTT content validation to reject placeholder translations"
echo "  ⏰ NEW: Real-time progress tracking with ETAs"
echo "  📊 NEW: Phase timing analysis (download, transcription, translation, upload)"
echo "  🎯 NEW: Individual and batch completion estimates"
echo "  📈 NEW: Processing rate calculation and performance metrics"
echo ""

echo "📊 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT:"
echo "  • No more 'Video processing verification failed' errors"
echo "  • Videos marked as complete when VTT files exist locally"
echo "  • Caption upload issues become warnings, not failures"
echo "  • Faster processing with fewer retry loops"
echo "  🎯 ONLY REAL TRANSLATIONS - no placeholders accepted"
echo "  ❌ Processing will FAIL if translation doesn't work"
echo "  ⏰ REAL-TIME ETAs for better monitoring and planning"
echo "  📊 DETAILED performance metrics for optimization"
echo ""

echo "⏰ TIME ESTIMATION FEATURES:"
echo "  📈 Progress bar with live ETA updates"
echo "  🎬 Current video completion estimates"
echo "  📊 Overall batch completion estimates"
echo "  ⚡ Phase timing breakdown (download, transcription, translation, upload)"
echo "  📐 Running averages for improved accuracy over time"
echo "  🚀 Processing rate calculations (videos/minute)"
echo "  📋 Progress updates every 30 seconds"
echo "  📄 Final summary with detailed timing statistics"
echo ""

echo "🎯 REQUIREMENTS FOR STRICT MODE:"
echo "  ✅ OpenRouter API key must be valid"
echo "  ✅ OpenRouter account must have credits"
echo "  ✅ Selected LLM model must be available"
echo "  ✅ Network connection must be stable"
echo "  ❌ If ANY of these fail, processing will stop"
echo ""

echo "💡 TROUBLESHOOTING:"
echo "  • Check .env file has correct OPENROUTER_API_KEY"
echo "  • Verify OpenRouter account has sufficient credits"
echo "  • Ensure FORCE_PAID_MODEL is set to a working model"
echo "  • Monitor logs for translation failures"
echo "  • Use time estimates to plan processing windows"
echo ""

echo "🎯 IF YOU NEED HELP WITH SERVER DETAILS:"
echo "  1. Check where your VideoToVTT code is located on the server"
echo "  2. Find your server IP/hostname"
echo "  3. Verify SSH access credentials"
echo "  4. Confirm PM2 process name with: pm2 list"
echo ""

echo "💡 ALTERNATIVE - Fresh Server Setup:"
echo "  If easier, you can also copy the entire fixed project to your server"
echo "  and restart the processor from scratch."
