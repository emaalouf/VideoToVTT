echo "üìã STEPS TO DEPLOY THE FIX:"
echo ""

echo "1Ô∏è‚É£  Copy the fixed fast-processor.js to your server:"
echo "   scp fast-processor.js user@your-server:/path/to/VideoToVTT/"
echo ""

echo "2Ô∏è‚É£  SSH into your server and restart PM2:"
echo "   ssh user@your-server"
echo "   cd /path/to/VideoToVTT"
echo "   pm2 restart videotovtt-turbo"
echo ""

echo "3Ô∏è‚É£  Monitor the logs to see the fix working:"
echo "   pm2 logs videotovtt-turbo --lines 50"
echo ""

echo "üîß WHAT WAS FIXED:"
echo "  ‚úÖ Verification now focuses on local VTT files (primary success criteria)"
echo "  ‚úÖ Uploaded captions are checked separately and don't block processing"
echo "  ‚úÖ Added 2-second delay for API sync before caption verification"
echo "  ‚úÖ More graceful handling of API delays and 404 errors"
echo ""

echo "üìä EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT:"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ No more 'Video processing verification failed' errors"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Videos marked as complete when VTT files exist locally"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Caption upload issues become warnings, not failures"
echo "  ‚Ä¢ Faster processing with fewer retry loops"

echo "üéØ IF YOU NEED HELP WITH SERVER DETAILS:"
echo "  1. Check where your VideoToVTT code is located on the server"
echo "  2. Find your server IP/hostname"
echo "  3. Verify SSH access credentials"
echo "  4. Confirm PM2 process name with: pm2 list"
echo ""

echo "üí° ALTERNATIVE - Fresh Server Setup:"
echo "  If easier, you can also copy the entire fixed project to your server"
echo "  and restart the processor from scratch."
